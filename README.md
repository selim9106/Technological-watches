# Technological watches
This repository is about technological watches I conduct during my Junior Developer Bootcamp @ [Becode](https://github.com/becodeorg). Each day, a student had to pick up a topic and give a talk about it.   

I considered this each time as research work. I wanted to learn something for myself and not just present something I already knew.
